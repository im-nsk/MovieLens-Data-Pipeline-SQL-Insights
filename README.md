Replace the first directory with your directory and run on the CMD
curl -o C:\Users\Username\Downloads\movieLens https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grouplens/movielens-20m-dataset

## Loading Data into Database:
Use Python and the pyodbc library to connect to your SQL Server database.
Read the MovieLens dataset files using Pandas.
Clean the data as necessary.
Use SQL queries to create tables in the database corresponding to the dataset schema.
Load the cleaned data into the database tables using batch processing or chunking techniques.

## Defining Database Schema:
Define primary keys for tables to uniquely identify each record.
Define foreign keys to establish relationships between tables.
Create indexes on columns to optimize query performance.

## Performing SQL Operations:
Execute SQL queries to perform data manipulation, filtering, aggregation, and other operations as needed.
Utilize SQL's powerful features for data analysis and transformation directly within the database.

## Visualization and Analysis:
Connect Power BI to your SQL Server database to create visualizations and dashboards.
Explore and analyze the data to extract insights and make data-driven decisions.

Steps to follow:
1. Download Dataset using CMD:
Execute a command in the command prompt (CMD) to download the MovieLens dataset.
2. Create Table:
Run SQL queries to create database tables based on the dataset schema.
3. Load Data:
Execute a Python script to load the data from the MovieLens dataset into the database tables.
4. Data Cleaning:
Clean the data to address any inconsistencies, missing values, or errors.
5. Primary Key Constraint:
Define primary key constraints to ensure each record in a table is uniquely identifiable.
6. Foreign Key Constraint:
Define foreign key constraints to establish relationships between tables.
7. Index Creation:
Create indexes on columns to improve query performance.
8. Data Operation:
Perform various SQL operations such as filtering, aggregation, or joining tables.
9. Fix Error While Loading:
Address any errors encountered during the data loading process, as mentioned in the SQL file provided.

Throughout the process, it's important to handle errors gracefully, maintain data integrity, and optimize performance for efficient data processing and analysis.
