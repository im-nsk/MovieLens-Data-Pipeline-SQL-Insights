/*Join Tables: You can join the tables to combine relevant information. For example, joining the "movies" table with the "ratings" table on the "movieId" column can give you ratings for each movie. Similarly, joining "movies" with "tags" can give you user-generated tags for each movie.
*/
--1. Calculate Average Ratings: With the joined table of movies and ratings, we can calculate the average rating for each movie. 

--2. Count Number of Ratings: We can count the number of ratings each movie has received. 

--3. List Most Common Tags: After joining the movies table with the tags table, we can list the most common tags associated with movies. 

-- 4. Explore Genre-Rating Relationship: We can analyze the relationship between movie genres and ratings by joining the movies table with the ratings table and grouping by genres.

/*
Aggregation: Calculate statistics such as average ratings, count of ratings, or average relevance of tags for each movie.*/
--1 Average Relevance of Tags for Each Movie:

/*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the data distribution, identify trends, and understand the characteristics of movies, ratings, tags, etc.*/
-- 1. Distribution of Ratings:

-- 2. Distribution of Genres:

-- 3. Trend of movie Over Time

-- 4. Number of Movies per Year 

-- 5. Average Ratings per Genre:


/*Genre Analysis: Analyze the distribution of genres among movies. You can count the occurrences of each genre and visualize them.*/
